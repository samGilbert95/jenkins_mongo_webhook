### Tech used

Chef was used to create and run the tests

### Challenges
---
Attempting to find resources on chef DSL test language, as well as connecting the mongod service at port 0.0.0.0

### Takeaways
---
I struggled quite a bit with this task, only being able to complete a number of the tests required. I feel that if i can find a good resource which explains common test commands, I will be able to get more familiar with it
